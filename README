# Erlang Excercies

This is a repo where I put my Erlang implementations for the O'Reilly Erlang
book.

I have 6 years on Ruby, I do professional Ruby On Rails along with some
javascript too. This is my entry point to functional programming.

At first I feared this type of programming because all the concurrency
management it has, and also because it lacks of object abstractions. I know
though, that its powerful.

## Inspiration

CircleCI is the product that forced me to put attention on what functional
programming can do. I mean, its just incredible what this guys do!

Eventhough they use Google Go or Clojure, I decided to jump into Erlang
because its older that than those two, so I think I will be able to grasp later
on the new languages optimizations.

## My Plan

Learn constantly, build criteria, be a rockstar like my role models.

* Aaron Paterson
* Jose Valim
* Corey Haines
* Avdi
* Chad Fowler
* DHH
* Yehuda
* Paul Biggar
* and so many more I can't remember right now.
